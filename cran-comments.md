## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Converted the DESCRIPTION title to title case.

* Removed the -fflag-store compile flag. 

* Added a very simple unit test to make sure yakmoR works as intended.

* Added a complete sentence to DESCRIPTION meta-information.

* Added the line ending in src/Makevars.

* Replaced the exit calls with Rcpp::stop() 


 
## Test environments
* local ubuntu 15.10 alpha2 install (64bit), R 3.2.1
* virtual ubuntu 15.04 install (32bit), R 3.2.1
* local OS X install, R 3.2.1
* win-builder (devel and release)
